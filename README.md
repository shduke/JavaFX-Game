#### Concept
Rooster Roaster is a 2-D space invaders like game where the 
goal is to shoot all of the chickens and roosters to advance 
to the next level and ultimately take on the boss in order to
win the game. The player must dodge the eggs and bird poop and
if the player loses all 3 lives then they lose and have to start
over.

#### Controls
  * Arrow keys to move
  * SPACE bar to shoot

#### Notes
  * The chickens have twice as much health as the roosters
  * Roosters fire faster than the chickens
  * Boss takes 20 shots to destroy
  * Boss has a special attack
  * Cheat codes are only accessible while playing the game (not available
  during the game over or menu screen).

#### Cheat Codes
  * "0" - Returns to the menu
  * "1" - Restarts the game at level 1 with 0 score and 3 lives

  * "3" - Goes to boss level
  * "4" - Goes to game over lose screen
  * "5" - Goes to game over win screen
